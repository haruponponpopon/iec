majestic and awe-inspiring view of a deep and wide glacial lake, surrounded by towering peaks, covered in snow and ice, with a small island in the center, and a small wooden cabin on the island, accessible only by boat, surrounded by lush green forests, and a small waterfall that cascades into the lake, with a clear blue sky, where a dragon circles over the lake.
